# Acute Asthma Exacerbation

Acute asthma exacerbations (AAE) are episodes of progressive worsening of asthma symptoms requiring urgent evaluation and treatment. Prompt assessment and early intervention improve outcomes and reduce hospitalizations.

<AsideMessage type="critical">
  **Life-threatening features requiring ICU consultation:**
  Silent chest, altered mental status, cyanosis, bradycardia, or hypotension.
</AsideMessage>

## Assessment

Initial evaluation should include:

- **Vital signs:** Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation
- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF):** If patient able to perform (compare to personal best or predicted)
- **Work of breathing:** Accessory muscle use, retractions, tripod positioning
- **Speech:** Ability to speak in full sentences vs. words only
- **Mental status:** Alertness, agitation, altered consciousness

<AsideMessage type="note">
  PEF may not be reliable in children under 5 years. Use clinical assessment primarily in young children.
</AsideMessage>

## Severity Classification

| Severity | PEF | O2 Saturation | Clinical Features |
|----------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | Greater than 70% | Greater than 95% | Minimal dyspnea, speaks in sentences |
| **Moderate** | 40-70% | 90-95% | Moderate distress, speaks in phrases |
| **Severe** | Less than 40% | Less than 90% | Severe distress, speaks in words |
| **Life-threatening** | Unable to perform | Less than 90% | Silent chest, altered consciousness |

## Initial Management

### First-Line Therapy

1. **Oxygen** - Target O2 saturation 93-95% (94-98% in children)

2. **Short-Acting Beta-Agonist (SABA)**
   - Albuterol nebulizer: 2.5-5 mg every 20 minutes for 3 doses
   - MDI with spacer: 4-8 puffs every 20 minutes for 3 doses

<AsideMessage type="warning">
  **Common error:** Inadequate initial dosing. Give full doses at appropriate intervals rather than continuous low-dose therapy initially.
</AsideMessage>

3. **Systemic Corticosteroids**
   - Start early (within first hour)
   - Prednisone/Prednisolone: 1-2 mg/kg PO once daily (max 60 mg) for 5 days
   - No taper needed for short courses

## Key Points

- Early recognition and treatment prevent progression
- Systemic corticosteroids should be given within the first hour
- Most patients can be managed with SABA, ipratropium, and steroids
- Discharge only when sustained improvement documented
- Schedule close follow-up to prevent future exacerbations
