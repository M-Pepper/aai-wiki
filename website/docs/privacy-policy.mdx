# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2025

At AAI Wiki, we prioritize your privacy. This policy explains what information is collected when you visit our website.

## Summary

- We do **not** collect personal data (names, emails, phone numbers) unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via GitHub).
- We do **not** use third-party advertising cookies.
- We do **not** sell your data.

## Data Collection

AAI Wiki is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**. We use **Cloudflare Web Analytics** to understand general site traffic and performance. This service is privacy-first and does not use client-side states, such as cookies or `localStorage`, to collect usage metrics.

### What Cloudflare Analytics Collects

Cloudflare collects non-personally identifiable information to provide us with aggregate statistics, such as:

- **Page Views:** Which pages are visited.
- **Referrers:** How you found the site (e.g., from a search engine).
- **Device Data:** Browser type, operating system, and device type (mobile/desktop).
- **Location:** Country and region (based on IP address, which is anonymized).

For more technical details, please refer to the [Cloudflare Web Analytics documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).

## Cookies

AAI Wiki does not set tracking cookies. However, some functional cookies may be set by third-party integrations if you interact with them (e.g., if you log in to GitHub to contribute).

## External Links

Our website contains links to external sites (e.g., PubMed, guideline organizations). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
