## Content Guidelines

### Evidence-Based Medicine

All clinical content must be:

1. **Evidence-based** - Cite guidelines, systematic reviews, or RCTs
2. **Current** - Use the most recent guidelines (e.g., GINA 2024)
3. **Unbiased** - No promotional content for drugs, devices, or companies
4. **Balanced** - Present controversies fairly when expert opinion differs

### Preferred Sources

In order of preference:

1. **Major guidelines**
   - GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma)
   - PRACTALL (Practical Allergy)

   - WAO (World Allergy Organization)

2. **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses**
   - Cochrane reviews
   - High-quality meta-analyses

3. **Randomized controlled trials**
   - Published in peer-reviewed journals

4. **Expert consensus statements**
   - When high-quality evidence is lacking

## Recognition

We value all contributions! Ways we recognize contributors:

- **Reviewer credits** - Recognition for expert reviews

## Our Contributors

All contributors to AAI Wiki are listed below. Thank you for making this resource possible!

<AsideMessage type="note">
  **Note:** The contributors list will be automatically populated once the GitHub repository is live. Contributors are shown based on their commits to the repository.
</AsideMessage>

### How the Contributors List Works

Once our GitHub repository is public, this section will display:

- **All contributors** who have made commits to the repository
- **Contribution statistics** showing the number of commits
- **Profile links** to each contributor's GitHub profile
- **Automatic updates** as new contributors join

The list uses GitHub's built-in contributors API, which automatically tracks:
- Code contributions (new features, bug fixes)
- Content contributions (new articles, updates)
- Documentation improvements
- Review and feedback

### Displaying Contributors

To manually display contributors on any page, you can use GitHub's contributors widget:

```html
<!-- This will be implemented after GitHub repository is created -->
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername/aai-wiki/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=yourusername/aai-wiki" />
</a>
```

This generates a visual grid of all contributor avatars with links to their profiles.

### Top Contributors

We'll also highlight top contributors based on:
- Number of commits
- Lines of code/content added
- Review participation
- Community engagement

**Coming soon:** Dedicated contributors page with detailed statistics and recognition.
