# About AAI Wiki

AAI Wiki is a free, open-access clinical reference for healthcare professionals specializing in allergy, asthma, and immunology.

## Mission

We believe that high-quality clinical information should be **accessible to everyone**—without paywalls, registration barriers, or hidden costs.

AAI Wiki democratizes medical knowledge by providing:

- **Evidence-based content** grounded in current clinical guidelines
- **Practical information** focused on clinical decision-making
- **Open access** to all resources without restrictions
- **Community collaboration** with expert review and discussion

### The Problem We're Solving

Too much valuable AAI content remains:
- Locked behind expensive journal subscriptions
- Scattered across multiple guideline websites
- Difficult to navigate during clinical encounters
- Updated infrequently or inconsistently

AAI Wiki consolidates the best evidence into a **single, searchable, always-accessible resource**.

## Core Values

### 1. Open Access
All content is free. Forever. No paywalls, no registration requirements, no hidden costs.

### 2. Evidence-Based Medicine
Every clinical recommendation cites current guidelines, systematic reviews, or high-quality primary literature. We don't publish opinions without evidence.

### 3. Diverse Perspectives
When expert opinion differs, we present multiple viewpoints fairly and document areas of ongoing controversy.

### 4. Community Collaboration
We actively encourage contributions from the AAI community. All content is reviewed by practicing allergists and immunologists.

### 5. Transparency
We disclose conflicts of interest, cite our sources, and maintain open discussion about controversial topics.

## How We Work

### Content Development

1. **Proposal** - New topics proposed via GitHub Issues
2. **Writing** - Content drafted by contributors with expertise
3. **Review** - Expert review by board-certified allergists/immunologists
4. **Discussion** - Controversial topics discussed openly in GitHub Discussions
5. **Publication** - Approved content merged and deployed
6. **Updates** - Regular updates as guidelines evolve

### Quality Assurance

All clinical content undergoes:
- Medical accuracy review by practicing specialists
- Evidence quality assessment
- Citation verification
- Conflict of interest disclosure
