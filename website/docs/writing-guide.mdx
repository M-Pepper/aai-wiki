# MDX Writing Guide

This guide teaches you how to write documentation files using MDX (Markdown + React components). No technical background required!

<AsideMessage type="tip">
  **New to MDX?** Think of it as a text document with simple formatting codes. This guide shows you everything you need.
</AsideMessage>

## What is MDX?

MDX files are plain text files that use simple symbols to add formatting. The file extension is `.mdx` instead of `.txt`. When saved, these files become beautifully formatted web pages.

## File Structure

Every MDX file must start with **front matter** - metadata between two `---` lines:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 5
title: My Page Title
description: A short description of what this page covers
---
```

**What each field means:**
- `sidebar_position`: A number controlling where this page appears in the menu (1 = first, 2 = second, etc.)
- `title`: The page title shown at the top and in browser tabs
- `description`: A brief summary (helps with search results)

After the second `---`, write your content normally.

## Basic Text Formatting

### Headings

Create headings using `#` symbols. More `#` symbols = smaller heading:

```markdown
# Largest Heading (H1)
## Large Heading (H2)
### Medium Heading (H3)
#### Small Heading (H4)
```

**Best practice:** Use only one H1 (`#`) per page - your main title. Use H2 (`##`) for major sections, H3 (`###`) for subsections.

### Making Text Bold, Italic, or Monospace

```markdown
**Bold text** - surround with double asterisks
*Italic text* - surround with single asterisks
`Monospace text` - surround with backticks (key above Tab)
```

**When to use each:**
- **Bold**: Important terms, emphasis, warnings
- *Italic*: Titles of publications, emphasis
- `Monospace`: Technical terms, specific values, codes

### Line Breaks and Paragraphs

- One line break: Just hit Enter once (stays in same paragraph)
- New paragraph: Hit Enter twice (creates space between paragraphs)

```markdown
This is one paragraph.
This line is part of the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph with space above it.
```

## Lists

### Bullet Points (Unordered Lists)

Use a dash `-` or asterisk `*` followed by a space:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

**Nested bullets** (indent with 2 spaces):

```markdown
- Main item
  - Sub-item
  - Another sub-item
- Another main item
```

### Numbered Lists (Ordered Lists)

Use numbers followed by a period:

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

**Nested numbers:**

```markdown
1. First step
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
2. Second step
```

**Tip:** You can use `1.` for every item and the numbers will auto-update:

```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
```

This still renders as 1, 2, 3 automatically!

## Tables

Create tables using pipes `|` and dashes `-`:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data A   | Data B   | Data C   |
| Data D   | Data E   | Data F   |
```

**Renders as:**

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data A   | Data B   | Data C   |
| Data D   | Data E   | Data F   |

**Tips:**
- The dashes `---` separate the header row from data rows
- Columns don't need to line up perfectly (but it's easier to read if they do)
- Need alignment? Add colons to the dashes:
  - `|:---|` = left-aligned
  - `|:--:|` = center-aligned
  - `|---:|` = right-aligned

## Links

### External Links

```markdown
[Link text here](https://example.com)
```

### Internal Links (to other pages on the site)

```markdown
[Link text](/path-to-page)
```

Examples:
```markdown
[Visit our homepage](/)
[Read the contributing guide](/contributing)
[See the asthma section](/asthma)
```

## Images

```markdown
![Alt text description](./path/to/image.png)
```

- `Alt text`: Describes the image (required for accessibility)
- Path can be relative (`./images/photo.png`) or absolute (`/static/img/photo.png`)

## Special Components

MDX allows custom React components. Here are the ones available in AAI Wiki:

### Alert Boxes (AsideMessage)

First, add this import at the top of your file (after the front matter):

```markdown
import AsideMessage from '@site/src/components/AsideMessage';
```

Then use it anywhere in your document:

```markdown
<AsideMessage type="note">
  This is a general information box.
</AsideMessage>

<AsideMessage type="tip">
  This is a helpful tip box (green).
</AsideMessage>

<AsideMessage type="warning">
  This is a warning box (orange).
</AsideMessage>

<AsideMessage type="danger">
  This is a critical warning box (red).
</AsideMessage>
```

**Example:**

<AsideMessage type="note">
  This is what a note looks like. Use it for general information.
</AsideMessage>

### Collapsible Sections

Use HTML `<details>` tags to hide content until clicked:

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Any content here will be hidden until the user clicks the summary.

- You can use
- Regular markdown
- Inside details tags

</details>
```

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Any content here will be hidden until the user clicks the summary.

- You can use
- Regular markdown
- Inside details tags

</details>

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Use single backticks for code within a sentence:

```markdown
The file is named `config.json` and contains settings.
```

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for multi-line code:

````markdown
```
This is a code block.
Multiple lines are preserved.
  Indentation is preserved.
```
````

**With syntax highlighting** (specify the language):

````markdown
```javascript
function example() {
  return "This will be syntax highlighted";
}
```
````

````markdown
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
````

## Comments (Hidden Notes)

Add comments that won't appear on the page:

```markdown
{/* This is a comment - it won't show on the published page */}
```

Use this for:
- Notes to yourself
- TODOs
- Explanations for other editors

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### ❌ Mistake 1: Forgetting Blank Lines

**Wrong:**
```markdown
## Heading
Content starts immediately
```

**Right:**
```markdown
## Heading

Content has a blank line above it
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Incorrect List Spacing

**Wrong:**
```markdown
- Item 1
  -Item 2 (no space after dash)
```

**Right:**
```markdown
- Item 1
  - Item 2 (space after dash and proper indent)
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Broken Tables

**Wrong:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2
|----------|---------- (missing pipe at end)
| Data | More data
```

**Right:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data | More data |
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Links with Spaces

**Wrong:**
```markdown
[Click here] (https://example.com) (space between ] and ()
```

**Right:**
```markdown
[Click here](https://example.com) (no space)
```

## MDX Best Practices

### 1. Use Consistent Heading Hierarchy

```markdown
# Page Title (only one per page)

## Main Section

### Subsection

#### Minor Point

## Another Main Section
```

Don't skip levels (e.g., H2 → H4 without an H3).

### 2. Keep Lines Short

Break long paragraphs into shorter ones. Each paragraph should cover one main idea.

**Good:**
```markdown
This paragraph introduces the topic.

This paragraph provides supporting detail.

This paragraph concludes the section.
```

### 3. Use Lists for Scanability

Convert long sentences with multiple items into lists:

**Instead of:**
```markdown
The benefits include ease of use, accessibility, and maintainability.
```

**Try:**
```markdown
The benefits include:
- Ease of use
- Accessibility
- Maintainability
```

### 4. Add Blank Lines Around Special Elements

Always put blank lines before and after:
- Headings
- Lists
- Tables
- Code blocks
- Images
- Components

### 5. Proofread Before Submitting

Check for:
- Spelling errors
- Broken links
- Missing images
- Incomplete tables
- Unmatched formatting symbols (e.g., single `*` instead of paired `**`)

## Quick Reference Template

Copy this template to start a new page:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: Page Title Here
description: Brief description of this page
---

import AsideMessage from '@site/src/components/AsideMessage';

# Page Title Here

Opening paragraph introducing the topic.

## First Major Section

Content for the first section.

### Subsection

More detailed information.

## Second Major Section

- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

<AsideMessage type="tip">
  Add helpful notes using alert boxes.
</AsideMessage>

## Summary

Concluding paragraph.
```

## Testing Your MDX File

Before submitting:

1. **Check the preview** - Most code editors show MDX/Markdown previews
2. **Verify all links work** - Click each link to confirm
3. **Check formatting** - Make sure headings, lists, and tables display correctly
4. **Read it out loud** - Catches awkward phrasing

## Getting Help

- **View the source** - Look at existing pages in the `website/docs` folder to see examples
- **Ask for help** - Submit your content even if you're unsure about formatting
- **Check the preview** - The site preview will show you exactly how it will look

<AsideMessage type="note">
  Don't worry about making it perfect! Other contributors will help improve formatting during the review process.
