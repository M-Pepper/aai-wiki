# UAS7 Calculator

The **UAS7 (Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days)** is a patient-reported outcome measure used to assess disease activity in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

## About UAS7

The UAS7 score ranges from **0 to 42** and tracks daily symptoms over **7 consecutive days**:

- **Daily Scoring:** Wheals (0-3) + Itching (0-3) = Daily Total (0-6)
- **Weekly Total:** Sum of all 7 daily scores (0-42)

### Interpretation

- **Well-controlled:** 0
- **Mild:** 1-6
- **Moderate:** 7-15
- **Severe:** 16-42

:::info Clinical Threshold
A score **≥11** has been validated with 74% sensitivity and 86% specificity for identifying patients requiring therapeutic intervention.

## How to Use

### Daily Scoring

Complete the assessment **once daily** for **7 consecutive days**. Score symptoms based on the past 24 hours.

### Wheals (Hives) Score

Rate the number of wheals:

- **0 = None** - No wheals
- **1 = Mild** - Less than 20 wheals in 24 hours
- **2 = Moderate** - 20 to 50 wheals in 24 hours
- **3 = Intense** - More than 50 wheals in 24 hours OR large confluent areas

### Itching (Pruritus) Score

Rate the severity of itching:

- **0 = None** - No itching
- **1 = Mild** - Present but not annoying or troublesome
- **2 = Moderate** - Troublesome but does not interfere with normal daily activity or sleep
- **3 = Intense** - Severe itching that interferes with normal daily activity or sleep

## Clinical Use

The UAS7 is used to:

- **Monitor disease activity** over time
- **Assess treatment response** to medications (e.g., antihistamines, omalizumab)
- **Guide treatment decisions** (dose adjustment, therapy changes)
- **Determine disease control** for step-down or discontinuation
- **Standardize endpoints** in clinical trials

## Tips for Accurate Tracking

1. **Score at the same time each day** (e.g., before bed)
2. **Be consistent** - Use the same assessment period
3. **Consider the entire day** - Not just the current moment
4. **Keep a diary** - Some patients find it helpful to track alongside
5. **Complete all 7 days** - Even if symptoms improve or resolve

## Response to Treatment

### Excellent Response
- UAS7 = 0 (symptom-free)
- Consider treatment step-down after sustained control

### Good Response
- UAS7 ≤6 (minimal symptoms)
- Continue current therapy

### Inadequate Response
- UAS7 >6 or no improvement from baseline
- Consider treatment adjustment or escalation
