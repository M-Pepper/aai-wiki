# SCORAD Calculator

The **SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis)** index is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (eczema). It combines objective clinical signs with subjective patient symptoms.

## About SCORAD

The SCORAD score ranges from **0 to 103** and consists of three components:

- **A: Body Surface Area (0-100)** - Extent of affected skin using the rule of nines
- **I: Intensity (0-18)** - Sum of 6 clinical signs (each scored 0-3)
- **S: Subjective Symptoms (0-20)** - Itch and sleep loss (each 0-10)

### Formula

```
SCORAD = (A/5) + (7I/2) + S
```

### Interpretation

- **Mild:** < 25
- **Moderate:** 25-50
- **Severe:** > 50

## Clinical Use

The SCORAD index is used to:

- **Assess disease severity** at initial evaluation
- **Monitor treatment response** over time
- **Guide treatment decisions** (step-up or step-down therapy)
- **Standardize reporting** in clinical trials

## Components Explained

### Body Surface Area (A)

Estimate the percentage of each body region affected:

| Region | Maximum BSA |
|--------|-------------|
| Head & Neck | 9% |
| Upper Limbs (each) | 9% |
| Lower Limbs (each) | 18% |
| Anterior Trunk | 18% |
| Back | 18% |
| Genitals | 1% |

### Intensity Signs (I)

Rate the intensity of these 6 signs on the **most affected area**:

1. **Redness (Erythema)**
2. **Swelling (Edema/Papulation)**
3. **Oozing/Crusting**
4. **Scratch Marks (Excoriation)**
5. **Skin Thickening (Lichenification)**
6. **Dryness**

Each sign is scored:
- 0 = None
- 1 = Mild
- 2 = Moderate
- 3 = Severe

### Subjective Symptoms (S)

Patient-reported symptoms over the **past 3 days** using a Visual Analogue Scale (0-10):

- **Itch (Pruritus):** 0 = no itch, 10 = worst imaginable
- **Sleep Loss:** 0 = no sleep loss, 10 = complete sleep loss
